# activity_to_kinetics
Python script for calculating reaction rates from activity experiments and analyzing enzyme kinetics of GT1 (UGT) enzymes. Developed as part of the study 'Characterizing family 1 glycosyltransferases (GT1, UGT) by reverse glycosylation: fast determination of acceptor specificity, donor specificity, hydrolysis, and enzyme stability.'
